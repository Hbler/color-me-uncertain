## Online Color Guessing Game

### About it
To learn more about the project, context, concept, and process, you can [read this article](https://lnkd.in/gpEz_5Pq).

### To Do list
**Elements/features that I didn't get to add yet**
>Visual/sound cues when the player got a match right or wrong

For now the only thing that changes are the amount of points, and the vanishing of the element when the match is right

>Make it responsive

I wanted this one on the first go, but creating a game is more complex from the “dev side” of it.

>Dark mode

Nowadays everything has it, so why not?

>Color blindness mode

Kinda obvious right, a game about colors should have a mode for people that don't see all the colors
